# Homework 2 Simulation Files

Each of the files q1.py, q2.py, and q3.py run simulations for DATA601 Homework 2 questions.

Tested this on Python 3.6, so may need at least that version to run these. The only new-ish feature I used was f-strings. Can't remember when those were introduced.

To run, open up a terminal and execute:
    
    python3 <script_file>

No arguments/parameters are accepted. The values needed for the specific simulation parameters (e.g., number of trials, ball color distributions) can be updated manually within the script.
